Top 5 Cities by Number of Employees in Small Businesses Data Visualization using R

Here is an example of a data visualization I created using the ggplot function. The programming language used is R.

The data and data wrangling was provided by Professor Kinson.

In this data visualization, I have plotted horizontal bar graph that displays the top 5 cities by the number of employees in small businesses, highlighting that Chicago ranks number one. The data set is the "SBA Business Loans", created by the Small Business Administration.
